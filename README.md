NBIS
====
This repository contains shell scripts that have been developed in the course of a lecture on IT-security (specfically biometrics) at Hochschule Rhein Waal in 2014/2015. 
It contains two shell scripts for enrolment of WSQ images and for authentication of users. 
The scripts utilize the NBIS tools of NIST (http://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/nbis.cfm) for the core biometric functionality.
